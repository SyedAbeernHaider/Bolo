ompt:

Build a complete animated React app UI using TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for a project named "BOLO" (Sign Detection App).
The UI must look cartoonic, fun, educational, and interactive, like a playful learning game for kids but with smooth, professional animations.
Use soft gradient backgrounds, rounded components, bouncy transitions, and subtle glowing effects.

Project setup is already done with Vite + Tailwind — just generate the React pages and components.

🌈 Theme Style:

Cartoonic & animated with light pastel colors

Use Framer Motion for transitions (page enter/exit, button hover, etc.)

Fonts: Poppins / Comic Neue

Components must be modern, responsive, and simple

Tailwind only (no Bootstrap)

Use emoji icons and smooth transitions wherever possible

📄 Pages Required:
🏠 1. Home Page

Title: “🖐️ BOLO — Learn to Speak with Signs”

Centered animated title (motion bounce-in)

Subtext: “Learn, Practice, and Master Sign Language Alphabets”

Button: “Start Learning” → navigates to Loading Page

Add cute waving hand animation or character on screen corner

⏳ 2. Loading Page

Animated loader (Framer Motion spinner or looping emoji)

Text: “Preparing your sign learning experience…”

After 7–8 seconds, auto-navigate to Name Input Page

Background: gradient (baby blue → light pink)

Add some floating bubbles or sparkles (CSS animation)

👤 3. Name Input Page

Animated card in center asking: “What’s your name?”

Cartoon hand or smiley face beside input field

Input: rounded text field with typing animation

Button: “Continue” → navigates to Sign Detection Page

Background: light gradient with fun floating shapes

✋ 4. Sign Detection Page

Split screen layout (responsive):

Left Side: Current alphabet + sample sign video (or image placeholder)

Right Side: Live webcam preview (integrated with Teachable Machine)

Top text: “Show the sign for letter: A”

Button: “Start Detection” → triggers countdown (3, 2, 1)

On success: green check animation (✅ + confetti)

On fail: red cross with shake animation (❌ try again)

Auto move to next alphabet after success

Animated progress bar showing alphabet completion

Background: playful gradient (like sky-blue to soft yellow)

🎉 5. Result / Congratulations Page

Text: “🎉 Great Job, [Name]! You’ve signed your full name!”

Subtext: “You’re one step closer to mastering sign language.”

Show a looping celebration animation or confetti rain

Button 1: “Replay Session”

Button 2: “Send Video to Email”

Add bouncing celebratory character or hand sign emojis

🧩 Extra Components

Navbar with animated logo (BOLO text with waving emoji)

Animated background with Framer Motion or CSS floating shapes

Sound effect placeholders for success/failure

Smooth route transitions using AnimatePresence

⚙️ Tech Info:

Use React Router for navigation between pages

Tailwind for styling

Framer Motion for animations

Keep components in /src/pages and /src/components folders

Teachable Machine code will be injected later in Sign Detection Page

Deliverables:

Home.jsx

Loading.jsx

NameInput.jsx

Detection.jsx

Result.jsx

Shared components: Navbar.jsx, AnimatedButton.jsx, BackgroundShapes.jsx

Goal:
A complete cartoonic and lively front-end for BOLO app that feels like an animated learning experience, smooth and interactive from start to finish.
